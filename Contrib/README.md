# Skins/Contrib

Skins should be grouped under directories named for the creator.

Only freely-licensed or open source skins please.

Do not upload skins by other creators unless you have written permission from that creator or it is already permitted by their license terms.

Always add a README file giving credits and a LICENSE file for the specific license under which the skins are released. If you are including skins from other creators include the written permission and date the permission was given.

If there are different licenses for some skins include the appropriate LICENSE file in the skin directory.
