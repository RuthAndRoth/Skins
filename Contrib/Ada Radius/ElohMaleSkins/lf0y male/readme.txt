"Another skins" are released under a "BSD license"--which allows you to pretty much copy, mod, transfer as you wish... so you could legally make and sell your own modifications to them or even just "as-is" without any modifications. Really! No, I don't have a rabid team of lawyers waiting to DMCA-pounce you...
